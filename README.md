## TALENT
This repo hosts the code for paper **"Zefeng Chen, Wensheng Gan, Gengsen Huang, Zhenlian Qi, Yan Li, and Philip S. Yu: TALENT: Targeted Mining of Non-overlapping Sequential Patterns. Submitted to TMIS, pp 1-28 (2023)."**

## Requirements
Java programming language.

## Running the program
A simple way is to run MainTestTALENT_bfs.java and MainTestTALENT_dfs.java.

## Benchmarks
- The data format used is the same as in the file data.txt. That is, different positive integers represent different terms. In addition, "-1" is used as the itemset separator and "-2" is used as the sequence separator.
- Additional datasets used in the paper can be accessed from the branch of datasets.
